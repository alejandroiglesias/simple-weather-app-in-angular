# Simple weather app in Angular

## Getting started

This project uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build the project and
run development tasks. Make sure you have Node installed first. Then, clone this repository, `cd`
into the directory where you cloned it and install the dependencies:

```
npm install && bower install
```

After all dependencies have been installed, you can run the development server to preview the app
(with live reload).

```
gulp serve
```

You can also build an optimized, production-ready version of the app.

```
gulp build
```
